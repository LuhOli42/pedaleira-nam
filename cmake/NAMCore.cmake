# Builds the `nam_core` static library from NeuralAmpModelerCore's NAM/
# sources. Upstream ships no CMake library target of its own (only test/bench
# executables under tools/), so we glob its sources ourselves -- the same
# pattern their own tools/CMakeLists.txt uses.
#
# NAM_SAMPLE_FLOAT is defined PUBLIC so the whole audio graph stays in
# float32, matching juce::AudioBuffer<float> -- no per-sample double<->float
# conversion at the NAMProcessor boundary.

# Pinned to the exact commit NeuralAmpModelerCore v0.5.4 itself vendors as
# its Dependencies/eigen submodule (checked via the GitHub contents API,
# not guessed) -- the 3.4.1 tag is close but NOT the same: it's missing
# Eigen::placeholders::lastN, which NAM/lstm.h uses, and fails to compile.
