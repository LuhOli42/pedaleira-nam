/**
    TONE3000 login (OAuth 2.0 + PKCE), tone search, and model download.

    Strictly a control-thread component: the audio thread never touches it,
    and per ARCHITECTURE.md the integration stays OPTIONAL -- the product
    works fully without it, loading .nam files from disk by hand.

    You need your own publishable client_id from tone3000.com -> Settings ->
    API Keys. There is no shared or demo client_id (verified against the
    official API docs and their example client repo), so this can't be
    hardcoded. Set it with setClientId(), or export TONE3000_CLIENT_ID.

    No client secret is used, and none is needed: PKCE exists precisely so
    that a public/native client like this never holds one. TONE3000's
    t3k_cs_... secret key is documented as server-only -- if you ever find
    yourself wanting to embed it here, that's a bug.

    Login itself is NOT done here: this class only builds the authorize URL
    and validates/exchanges the code once the UI hands it back (see
    beginLogin()/completeLogin()). There's no system-browser launch and no
    local HTTP listener -- the UI shows the authorize page in an embedded
    WebBrowserComponent (Source/UI/OAuthLoginDialog) and intercepts
    navigation to the redirect URI itself. That's not a PC-only shortcut:
    it's the only login flow that also works on the final target (a
    touchscreen device with no browser installed at all), and it happens to
    be TONE3000's own documented recommendation for native apps.
