/**
    One-pole peak envelope follower with independent attack/release times.
    Reused for two different jobs across the built-in effects: tracking an
    input's level (GateProcessor's internal detector, CompressorProcessor's
    detector) and smoothing a target gain toward 0/1 (GateProcessor's gate
    transition itself). Same math, different callers.

    Realtime-safe: no allocation, no branching beyond a single comparison,
    safe to call once per sample from process().
