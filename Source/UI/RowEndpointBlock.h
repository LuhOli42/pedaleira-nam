    The tile at either end of one chain row: what feeds that row (left) or
    where that row goes (right) -- e.g. Quad Cortex's "In 1" / "Out 1/2"
    tiles, except the right-hand one can also say "LINE 2", because a row's
    output can be another row rather than the device.

    Deliberately dumb: it shows two lines of text (or a "+" when nothing is
    chosen yet) and reports clicks. MainComponent owns the menu, because
    what's offered depends on the whole routing picture -- which rows would
    make a loop, which device channels exist -- not on anything this tile
    could know by itself. Was IOSelectorBlock, when a row's only possible
    endpoints were physical device channels.
