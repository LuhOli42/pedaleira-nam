    Full-window modal host for anything that used to be a separate OS
    window (juce::DialogWindow / juce::DocumentWindow) -- TONE3000 login,
    TONE3000 search, the installed-models list. This product is a
    standalone touchscreen pedalboard, not a desktop app: there's no window
    manager to place a second window sensibly, and "open another window"
    isn't a mental model a pedalboard should ever ask of its player. So
    every one of those "popups" is instead a card drawn on top of the
    single app window, mobile-app-sheet style -- see AGENT.md's UI/UX
    Design Philosophy section.

    Supports stacking (pushOverlay/popOverlay) because TONE3000 login opens
    a further card (the embedded browser) on top of the account panel.
    Tapping outside the top card dismisses just that card, same as a phone
    bottom sheet.
