/**
    Sora (SIL OFL, embedded -- see Assets/Fonts/SORA-LICENSE.txt)
    everywhere instead of whatever generic sans the OS happens to have --
    the final target is a from-scratch embedded Linux build with no
    guaranteed font at all, and the default JUCE font reads as generic
    "desktop app", not a real product. Was Inter until 2026-09-10; swapped
    per user request for something that reads less like a stock UI font and
    more like a purpose-built gear product.

    Also bumps the popup menu font, which is what makes
    juce::PopupMenu AND juce::ComboBox's dropdown touch-sized:
    ComboBox has no per-instance "row height" hook the way
    PopupMenu::Options::withStandardItemHeight() does (used directly at
    each PopupMenu call site -- see Source/UI/TouchSizing.h), so this is
    the one place that also covers architectureBox
    (Tone3000SearchDialog's A1/A2/Custom picker) and any future
    juce::ComboBox.
