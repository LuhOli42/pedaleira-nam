# OpenGuitarMultiFx

*codename: cheapCortex*

A digital guitar processor for live use — realtime audio engine in C++/JUCE, Neural Amp Modeling, and TONE3000 integration. Validated first on an x86 PC, then ported to dedicated hardware.

> Reference document. Web version with diagrams: `OpenGuitarMultiFx` (artifact published 2026-09-06).
> Rev. 0.2 — 2026-09-07

**Development strategy:** all of Phases 0–5 run on a **regular x86 Linux PC**, with native JUCE over ALSA/PipeWire. The final hardware (Radxa Cubie A7S + touchscreen) only enters at Phase 6, once the Audio Engine has already been validated without depending on it.

## 0. Summary and classification

| Component | Exists? | ARM / Linux | Realtime | License | Commercial use | Classification |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **NeuralAmpModelerCore** (`sdatkinson/NeuralAmpModelerCore`) | Yes, active | Yes — proven on RPi4/5 | Yes, own engine (Eigen), no NPU dependency | MIT | Free | 🟢 EXISTS TODAY |
| **NeuralAudio** (`mikeoliphant/NeuralAudio`) | Yes, active | Yes — dedicated SIMD for RPi4 (128-bit) and RPi5 (256-bit) | Yes | MIT | Free | 🟢 EXISTS TODAY |

**Direct reading:** the inference engine (NAM Core / NeuralAudio / RTNeural) is a solved problem — MIT/BSD, active, already runs on ARM Cortex-A72/A76 without an NPU. What still needs a project decision: (1) the TONE3000 commercial agreement for a hardware product, (2) Elk Audio OS vs. building our own ALSA+JACK2 stack, (3) how much the Cubie A7S bring-up delays Phase 6. None of these block Phase 0–5 work.

## A. Complete architecture

Two execution lines with a single rule: **the audio thread never waits on the control thread.** Anything that touches disk, network, or UI only mutates its own copies, and hands off to the audio thread through an atomic pointer swap or a lock-free queue.

```

```

The bridge between the two sides is always one of three primitives: **atomic pointer swap** (models/graphs), **lock-free SPSC queue** (parameters and telemetry), or **double buffering** (whole presets). No other form of communication crosses this line.

### Split / merge

The Signal Graph is drawn as a single box because the internal order is free, but the same engine supports branching:

```

## B. Hardware

### Phase 0–5 · Dev bench
- Platform: x86-64 PC, Linux (any distro with ALSA/PipeWire)
- Audio: class-2 USB interface (e.g. Focusrite Scarlett Solo) for real guitar input
- Toolchain: native JUCE + CMake — the same source code as the ARM target
- Marginal cost: ≈ $0 (existing machine) + audio interface if needed

### Phase 6+ · Target hardware
- SBC: **Radxa Cubie A7S** — Allwinner A733 (2×A76 + 6×A55), 3-TOPS NPU **not usable for NAM**
- Audio: **no onboard codec confirmed** — requires an external I2S HAT/board with instrument-level input
- Display: USB-C with DisplayPort Alt-Mode (4Kp60) + GPIO header with an LCD function; touch via a USB-HID controller
- Kernel: vendor BSP (5.15 / 6.6) — mainline and PREEMPT_RT still in community bring-up

### Documented fallback
If audio/RT bring-up on the Cubie A7S doesn't mature in time for Phase 6, the path with real embedded-product evidence (NeuralPi, the NAM author's own blog) is **Raspberry Pi 4/5** — mature kernel, large community, A72/A76 CPU proven sufficient for multiple NAM models via RTNeural without an NPU. **Orange Pi 5 Plus (RK3588)** is the best-CPU-per-dollar alternative, at the cost of a still-incomplete mainline kernel in 2026. Neither choice needs to be made now — the software architecture (Sections C/D) does not reference specific hardware at any layer.

| Criterion | Radxa Cubie A7S | Raspberry Pi 5 | Orange Pi 5 Plus (RK3588) |
|---|---|---|---|
| CPU | 2×Cortex-A76@2.0GHz + 6×A55@1.8GHz | 4×Cortex-A76@2.4GHz | 4×Cortex-A76@2.4GHz + 4×A55 |
| RAM | LPDDR5, 4–16GB | LPDDR4X, up to 8GB | LPDDR4/4X, 4–32GB |
| Onboard audio codec | 🔴 not confirmed | 🟡 no, but HiFiBerry is a proven path | 🟡 no, community documents I2S |
| Kernel | 🟠 BSP, not mainline | 🟢 mature, mainline | 🟡 mainline in progress |
| PREEMPT_RT | 🔴 not confirmed | 🟡 works, spikes under stress | 🟡 mainline since 6.12, not validated |
| Realtime audio precedent | 🔴 none found | 🟢 NeuralPi, NAM blog, Zynthian | 🔴 none found |
| Approx. price (2026) | $25–44 | $110–175 (DRAM price surge) | $90–129 |

class EffectProcessor {

private:
    std::atomic<bool> bypassed { false };
};
```

## D. Audio Engine (realtime)

**The audio thread never:**
- calls `malloc`/`new`/`free` outside of `prepare()`
- takes a blocking mutex (only lock-free structures or `std::atomic` are allowed)
- performs network I/O, disk I/O, or file logging
- calls anything with non-deterministic latency (exceptions, dynamic RTTI, string allocation)
- waits on any response from the control thread

| Block size | @ 48 kHz | @ 96 kHz | Recommended use |
|---|---|---|---|
| 32 samples | 0.67 ms | 0.33 ms | final live target, after profiling |
| 64 samples | 1.33 ms | 0.67 ms | standard production target |
| **128 samples** | **2.67 ms** | 1.33 ms | **Phase 1 starting point, on PC** |
| 256 samples | 5.33 ms | 2.67 ms | debug / profiling only, never in production |

Round-trip latency target (input → output, including the driver): **< 10 ms** — generally accepted as the threshold before the response to a picked string starts to feel off to the player. Default sample rate: **48 kHz**; 96 kHz is reserved for once the CPU budget allows it without sacrificing the number of simultaneous NAM instances.

---

## E. Phase 1 in detail

**Pedals:** Noise Gate, Compressor, Boost, Overdrive, Distortion, Fuzz, EQ — each an independent `EffectProcessor` (see Section C), with no state shared between instances.

**NAM — inference engine:** implemented directly on **NeuralAmpModelerCore** (sdatkinson, upstream, MIT) — not NeuralAudio as originally scoped here, because NeuralAudio's CMake requires git submodules at fixed relative paths (not FetchContent-friendly) and its bundled test models are CC BY-NC-ND (unusable in a commercial test suite anyway). `NAMProcessor` wraps `nam::DSP`, with the model loaded on the control thread and handed to the audio thread through the same atomic-swap `DeferredReclaimer` pattern the SignalGraph itself uses. The same class serves both the amp position and a "neural drive" position (`NAMAmp`/`NeuralDrive` in `EffectRegistry`) — only the trained `.nam` file loaded into an instance differs. RTNeural remains an option for lightweight LSTM models later. None of these depend on an NPU — all processing is CPU-bound, with NEON where available.

**Cab / IR:** **partitioned convolution** strategy — long IRs (>100ms) are too expensive with direct convolution, and "pure" FFT convolution introduces block latency incompatible with live use. JUCE already exposes `dsp::Convolution` with uniform partitioning built in — a real, not just theoretical, starting point for Phase 1.

**TONE3000 — model pipeline:**

```
Tone3000Manager  →  ModelRepository  →  ModelValidator  →  ModelLoader  →  EffectRegistry
 (OAuth2+PKCE,        (local library      (checksum,         (parsed off        (atomic swap
  search, download)    + cache)            format)             the audio thread)  into the Signal Graph)
```

Authentication via OAuth 2.0 + PKCE (public `client_id` + server-side secret key), as officially documented by TONE3000. Relevant endpoints: `/tones`, `/models`, `/makes`, `/tags`, with a 100 req/min rate limit. **Pending item to resolve before committing product marketing/architecture to it:** the public terms don't explicitly distinguish a "software app" from an "embedded hardware device" — direct contact with `support@tone3000.com` is a prerequisite, not optional. That's why `Tone3000Manager` is designed as a pluggable, optional module: the product works in full without it (models loaded manually from a `.nam` file).

**Model Repository:**

```
/models
  /nam        # NeuralAmpModeler models (.nam / JSON)
  /aida-x     # reference only, not used at runtime by default (GPL)
  /ir         # cabinet impulse responses
/metadata     # id, source, author, checksum, size, date
/presets      # JSON: chain + order + parameters + model references
/cache        # temporary TONE3000 downloads, never read by the audio thread
```

**Presets:** each preset serializes the `EffectProcessor` chain (type + order), parameters, model/IR references (by checksum, not absolute path), and — where applicable — the TONE3000 tone ID to allow re-downloading if the local cache was cleared. Preset switching uses **double buffering**: the next graph is built and "warmed up" (buffers zeroed, filters in a steady state) as a whole separate copy, and only then swapped in via an atomic pointer — zero clicks, zero silence.

## F. Roadmap

| Phase | Deliverable | Hardware |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Architecture + JUCE/CMake skeleton | PC x86 |
| 1 | Audio Engine + Signal Graph + basic pedals + NAM + Cab/IR + TONE3000 + Presets | PC x86 |
| 2 | Delay + Reverb (algorithmic and convolution) | PC x86 |
| 3 | Modulation (chorus, flanger, phaser, tremolo, vibrato, rotary, ring mod) | PC x86 |
| 4 | Pitch (shifter, octaver, harmonizer, detune) | PC x86 |
| 5 | Looper, tuner, noise reduction, advanced EQ/compression, advanced routing, MIDI, expression | PC x86 |
| 6 | Port to the Radxa Cubie A7S: kernel/RT bring-up, audio codec via I2S HAT, real benchmarks | Cubie A7S |
| 7 | Full touch UI (built on the lock-free queue already present since Phase 1) | Cubie A7S + touchscreen |
| 8 | Footswitches, physical MIDI, expression pedal | Cubie A7S |
| 9 | Custom hardware (PCB, chassis, power supply, EMI/EMC) | Custom PCB |
| 10 | Optimization and live-use validation (soak test, cyclictest, real shows) | Final product |

The UI is designed for touch from Phase 1 onward — not because the screen physically exists yet, but because the Audio Engine already exposes state through a lock-free queue from the very first commit. This avoids rewriting the realtime boundary once Phase 7 arrives.

## G. Benchmarks

No official source publishes a reliable CPU/latency number for NAM on ARM — the reports found are anecdotal forum posts. The values below are **project targets to validate empirically**, not literature citations.

| Scenario | CPU target | Xruns in 30 min |
|---|---|---|
| 1 · NAM alone | < 15% | 0 |
| 2 · NAM + IR (cab) | < 25% | 0 |
| 3 · NAM + 1 pedal | < 30% | 0 |
| 4 · Multiple pedals (gate+comp+drive+eq) | < 40% | 0 |
| 5 · Two amps in parallel (split/merge) | < 55% | 0 |
| 6 · Full chain | < 70% | 0 |

Metrics collected per scenario: CPU%, RAM, measured round-trip latency, xrun count, SoC temperature, preset-switch time (target: imperceptible, < 5 ms of silence/click). `cyclictest` runs alongside every soak test on the target hardware, since no source guarantees PREEMPT_RT latency numbers on that SoC.

---

## H. BOM (initial estimate)

Prices in USD, Sep/2026 — subject to the same DRAM volatility that already affected the Raspberry Pi 5 this year.

| Item | Phase | Approx. cost |
|---|---|---|
| Development PC | 0–5 | $0 (existing) |
| Class-2 USB audio interface | 0–5 | $100–200 |
| Radxa Cubie A7S (8GB) | 6 | $30–40 |
| Instrument-level I2S audio codec HAT/board | 6 | $15–35 *(not confirmed — needs electrical validation)* |
| Touchscreen panel + USB-HID controller | 7 | $25–60 |
| Footswitches, encoders, LEDs, enclosure, power supply | 8–9 | $50–150 *(placeholder, to be detailed in Phase 9)* |

---

## I. Risks

| Severity | Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🔴 High | Cubie A7S has no confirmed onboard audio codec, vendor BSP kernel, RT not validated | Could delay all of Phase 6 | PC-first strategy already isolates this from Phases 0–5; RPi5/RK3588 documented as fallback (Section B) |
| 🔴 High | TONE3000 terms for commercial embedded hardware not publicly confirmed | Could block commercial distribution with the integration enabled | Direct contact with `support@tone3000.com` before committing marketing; `Tone3000Manager` designed as optional |
| 🟡 Medium | Target SoC's NPU is useless for NAM (no causal/dilated Conv1D in RKNN/eIQ/VIP9000) | None — this is a known design constraint, not a future surprise | Architecture already assumes CPU-only from Fig. 1 onward; don't budget NPU into any benchmark |
| 🟡 Medium | No guaranteed PREEMPT_RT latency number on any low-cost ARM SBC | Buffer size may need to increase in production, affecting playing feel | `cyclictest` + extensive soak testing on target hardware before locking in a final buffer size (Section G) |
| 🟡 Medium | Reference code (AIDA-X, GuitarML) is GPL-3.0 — license contamination if copied literally | Would force opening up the product's source if linked into a closed binary | Use only as architectural reference; own implementation on top of NAM Core/RTNeural (MIT/BSD) |
| 🟢 Low | DRAM price volatility (already visible in the Raspberry Pi 5 in 2026) | BOM may vary between the estimate and the actual purchase | Treat Section H as a range, not a locked quote; revisit before Phase 9 |
